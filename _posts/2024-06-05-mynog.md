Hey everyone! 🌟 I’m excited to share my journey attending the Malaysia Network Operator Group (MYNOG) conference, which took place at the impressive CCEC @ NEXUS in Bangsar South, Kuala Lumpur. Big shout-out to our incredible lecturer, Associate Prof. Dr. Ling Teck Chaw, for giving us the opportunity—and the tickets worth RM 100 each—to attend this real-world tech conference. It was an invaluable experience as a student diving into the future of networking.

# Talks That Stole the Show
There were plenty of great sessions, but three talks really caught my eye: SRv6: Deployment & Use Cases, Shadowserver: Internet Critical Security as a Public Service, and Container Lab: Unleashing the Power of Containerization for Network Testing and Development.

## Container Lab: Unleashing Network Testing Power
Thomas Corre’s presentation from Nokia was a game-changer. He took us through how Containerlab, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, is redefining network testing and development. I was fascinated by how it simplifies building, modifying, and replicating network topologies through containerized environments. It was amazing to see Containerlab’s support for a wide range of network operating systems like Nokia SR Linux and SROS. The step-by-step demos on node setups, link creation, and seamless interaction with deployed labs were just chef’s kiss. The highlight? A real-world example involving VPLS service provider topologies and how Containerlab is perfect for continuous integration and automation. 🎉

## Shadowserver: Cybersecurity’s Unsung Hero
Next up was Barry Greene’s eye-opening session on the Shadowserver Foundation. Honestly, I didn’t realize the sheer impact this non-profit has on global cybersecurity until now. Barry explained how Shadowserver acts as a cyber-civil defense service, providing unmatched, free threat intelligence to organizations. The suite of services they offer is beyond impressive—think botnet infiltration, malware sinkholes, global scans, and daily risk reports available via email or API. The best part? It’s accessible even to organizations with limited budgets. Barry’s talk reinforced how simple, consistent security practices can go a long way in strengthening defenses without breaking the bank. 💪

## SRv6: Modernizing Network Infrastructure
Finally, Aditya Kaul’s session on SRv6, brought to us by Juniper Networks, was packed with insights. He broke down the benefits of SRv6 over traditional MPLS, like operational simplicity, better scalability, and smooth integration with IPv6. What really stood out was the detailed look at practical deployment phases, from dual-stack IPv6 integration to SRv6-TE and network slicing for better traffic engineering. Aditya didn’t shy away from the challenges of deploying SRv6 in a multi-vendor environment either—talk about some real-world hurdles! He also touched on how SRv6 compression techniques could make a big difference in optimizing bandwidth and service delivery. 🚀

# The Perks and the Vibes
Oh, and did I mention the food? Top-notch! Plus, we got some cool merchandise for participating in quizzes and surveys—always a win in my book. 🛍️ The entire experience was an amazing mix of learning, networking, and a little bit of fun. It’s not every day you get to attend such a well-rounded conference that serves up knowledge and delicious snacks. 😄

Overall, MYNOG 2023 was a fantastic experience that gave me a deeper understanding of where the networking industry is headed. As a student, this was a huge opportunity to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world tech. Below are some pictures that being taken along the journey:
