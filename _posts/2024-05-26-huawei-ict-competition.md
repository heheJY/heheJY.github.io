I’m excited to share my rollercoaster journey through the Huawei-sponsored networking competition circuit—an epic adventure that stretched over six to seven months, from the initial preliminary rounds to the grand finale at the Global level. 🏆 If you’re even slightly intrigued by competitive networking, buckle up and read on for the insider scoop on each stage, plus a few tips for future contenders. 🌐

# The 4-Stage Path to Global Glory
This competition isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a multi-tiered battle royale of brainpower, featuring four rounds: Preliminary, National, Asia Pacific (Regional), and Global. Each round tests participants in unique ways, scaling up in difficulty and scope as you progress.

## 1. Preliminary: The Foundation
Kicking off the journey is the Preliminary round, where universities pit their best students against each other to earn a spot in the next phase. In my case, it meant competing among fellow University of Malaya (UM) students. This round is all about multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and raw memorization. 📚 From protocol headers and numbers to wireless bands and network fundamentals, you need to drill down on the HCIA materials to pass. It's not glamorous, but mastering these basics lays the groundwork for future success. And trust me, you’ll be dreaming about protocol tables by the end of it. 😅

## 2. National: Raising the Stakes
The National round takes things up a notch, where you face off against students from other universities in Malaysia. Only the top scorer in the entire country secures a ticket to the Asia Pacific round—talk about high stakes! The exam still focuses on MCQs but branches out to cover more advanced topics, dipping its toes into HCIP routing and switching. So, if you’re the kind of person who thrives under pressure and can recite network commands in your sleep, this is where you’ll shine. 💤💻

## 3. Asia Pacific (Regional): The Real Test Begins
Making it to the Asia Pacific stage? Now things get serious. For my year, this competition round was held in a physical location somewhere in the region (the last time, it was hosted in Indonesia). It’s a blend of MCQs and an intimidating lab exam that spans four hours, pushing you to your mental and technical limits. This isn’t just about memorizing facts; this is where you flex your configuration muscles. 💪 Topics range from HCIP advanced routing and switching to data center tech (hello, VXLAN and EVPN) and WAN bearers. The catch? For my batch, the lab was exceptionally tough, way more challenging than the questions from previous years. It felt like we needed HCIE-level knowledge even though we had only prepped for HCIP. A plot twist, for sure! 🤯

## 4. Global: The Ultimate Showdown
If you conquer the Regional round, you move on to the Global stage, where the stakes—and the labs—reach their peak. Picture this: an 8-hour marathon lab that tests your mettle on topics spanning HCIE WLAN, HCIE Datacom, and HCIP Security. 🛡️ The upside? The labs at this level tend to be similar each year, so once you’ve practiced with all the HCIE labs and simulated them in eNSP, you’re in good shape. This is where all those sleepless nights of lab practice pay off. Finish all the labs and you’ll be golden. ✨ And here’s a sweet bonus—the entire competition, including the trip to the Global round, is covered by Huawei Malaysia. Imagine competing with top tech talent worldwide while on an all-expenses-paid journey. Pretty cool, right? 🏖️✈️

# The Sweet and the Bittersweet
There’s a catch, though. If you make it to the Global level for a specific track (like Networking), you can’t compete in the same track the next year. But, hey, don’t fret—you can always pivot to another track like Cloud or Computing. 🌥️💻 My advice? Focus on mastering your advanced network courses before eyeing this competition. Once you're confident, dive headfirst into the challenge!

# Pro Tips for Future Warriors
If you’re thinking of taking on this competition, here are some gold nuggets from my experience:

Preliminary & National Prep: Memorize like your life depends on it. Dive deep into protocols, numbers, and wireless bands. MCQs are all about attention to detail.
Regional Tactics: Gear up for labs that cover HCIP advanced routing/switching, data centers, and WAN concepts. Familiarize yourself with configurations, because you'll be tested on practical knowledge.
Global Strategy: Simulate all HCIE labs using tools like eNSP. The more hands-on you are, the better you’ll perform. The labs are intensive, so prepare for an endurance test. ⏳
So, if you’re ready for a half-year journey of relentless learning, testing, and a potential world-class showdown, this competition is for you. Good luck, future network warriors! 🌍✨
