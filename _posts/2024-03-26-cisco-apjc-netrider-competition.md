The Cisco APJC NetAcad NetRider competition, held in March 2024, was nothing short of an exhilarating experience! üéâ This interactive contest is designed to put networking skills to the test, enrich classroom knowledge, and foster connections among students across the region‚Äîall while sparking enthusiasm for further tech education and training. Organized by Cisco, the competition is an incredible opportunity for Networking Academy students to showcase their abilities through a series of online exams and simulation activities using Cisco Packet Tracer. The 2024 challenge was open to students enrolled in a Cisco Networking Academy CCNA v7.0 course between January 1st, 2023, and January 31st, 2024. Lucky for me, my university nominated me to participate, and to top it off, I managed to earn a shiny gold certificate! ü•á

The exam itself consisted of multiple-choice questions, drawn from the core knowledge in the Cisco NetAcad modules. Proctored and timed for 1 hour and 30 minutes, this test kept us on our toes. I found that the study materials provided on the NetAcad site were super helpful for preparation. But I didn‚Äôt stop there‚Äîoh no! I delved into the CCNA Official Guide, which offered concise and crystal-clear explanations that really clicked for me. Shout-out to Jeremy‚Äôs IT Lab on YouTube, whose videos came to my rescue on topics like OSPF and others that needed a bit more visual breakdown. üìö Just a few days before the competition, I took the plunge into Google for extra CCNA practice questions. All these resources combined were key to acing most of the questions.

Reflecting on my performance, I noticed I tripped up a bit on the wireless networking section‚Äîoops! There were about three or four questions that caught me off-guard. Still, I managed to handle the IP header questions well, which was a relief. The questions didn‚Äôt go deep into one topic but were spread out across various fields, making the test comprehensive and engaging. There were even a few questions on configuration commands that tested our practical know-how. üñ•Ô∏è

Overall, it is a good competition to participate as it gives me a new cert for decoration on my resume. It was held annually, so grab your chance to participate for your university!
